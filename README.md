# ShelterManagement

Introduction: 
A shelter provides temporary homes for stray or unwanted pet animals which can be offered later for adoption. This shelter needs a set of interfaces and classes to manage petsâ€™ adoption. This shelter can accommodate two types of pets: Cats and Dogs. The services offered by the shelter are:
- Adding a new pet to the shelter (the shelter needs to be able to issue them an ID)
- Giving an existing pet to a customer for adoption (customer must have a record)

Dogs can only get adopted to customers who own a garden. A customer can adopt 3 pets at most. Only Dogs can be trained.

The shelter should maintain a record of pets added to the shelter. The shelter needs to maintain another record that associates a customer with the pets they have adopted.


The solutions demonstrate:
- The sensible use of Java inheritance mechanisms, an understanding of how to use interfaces,
- The ability to handle collections of objects,
- The use of defensive programming, including use of immutability, appropriate error handling, validation of input and using appropriate accessors and modifiers on instance variables, methods, and classes.
- An understanding of when and how to override Object methods,
- The implementation of factories,
- The ability to implement simple algorithms,
- The ability to write Javadoc comments, and
- The ability to test your code.
