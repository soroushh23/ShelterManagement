# ShelterManagement-

Introduction: 
A shelter provides temporary homes for stray or unwanted pet animals which can be offered later for adoption. This shelter needs a set of interfaces and classes to manage petsâ€™ adoption. This shelter can accommodate two types of pets: Cats and Dogs. The services offered by the shelter are:
- Adding a new pet to the shelter (the shelter needs to be able to issue them an ID)
- Giving an existing pet to a customer for adoption (customer must have a record)

Dogs can only get adopted to customers who own a garden. A customer can adopt 3 pets at most. Only Dogs can be trained.

The shelter should maintain a record of pets added to the shelter. The shelter needs to maintain another record that associates a customer with the pets they have adopted.
